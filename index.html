<p class="First">What is CSS?</p>
<ol type="1">
    <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
    <br>
    <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper or in other media.</li>
    <br>
    <li><span class ="two">CSS is not necessary</span>.<span class="one">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
    <br>
    <li id = "p1">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
</ol>
<p class ="First">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.</li>
    <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section.</li>
    <li>External - by using a link element to link an external CSS file.</li>
    <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="one">in this<br>
     tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier<br>
     for you to try it yourself.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elemnts. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also
    special in that you can uswe a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
    <br></br>

    In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an elements has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the
    element.
    <br></br>

    There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
